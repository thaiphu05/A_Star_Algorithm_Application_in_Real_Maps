# A* Algorithm Application in Real Maps

⭐ **A* Algorithm Application in Real Maps Using OSMnx and NetworkX**  
📌 *Course Project - Introduction to AI (SOICT, HUST)*

---

## 📌 Overview
This project implements the **A* Search Algorithm** on real-world maps using data from **OpenStreetMap (OSM)**. The graph is built with **OSMnx** and **NetworkX**, and the algorithm is applied to find the shortest path between two points in a real-world road network ( O cho Dua, Dong Da, Ha Noi, Viet Nam).

---

## 📂 Features
✅ **Graph Construction from OSM Data**: Extract real-world road networks.  
✅ **A* Algorithm Implementation**: Custom implementation without built-in shortest path functions.  
✅ **Visualization**: Display graph and computed shortest paths.  
✅ **Customizable Heuristic**: Supports different heuristics for pathfinding.

| Attribute  | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **osmid**  | Road ID in OpenStreetMap |
| **highway** | Road type (residential, primary, etc.) |
| **oneway**  | Indicates if the road is one-way |
| **reversed** | Road direction when loaded from OSM |
| **length**  | Road length (in meters) |
| **geometry** | GPS data of the road (LINESTRING) |
